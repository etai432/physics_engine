# 2D Physics Engine in Rust

This project is a 2D physics engine developed in Rust to simulate the behavior of circles under various physical conditions. It includes features such as gravity simulation for different celestial bodies in the solar system, customizable friction effects, color selection for circles, and adjustable size and initial speed parameters.

## Features

- Gravity Simulation: Simulates the gravitational effects of different celestial bodies in the solar system.
- Friction Effects: Customizable friction effects to simulate different surface conditions for the circles.
- Color Selection: Includes a color selector for customizing the colors of the circles.
- Size and Weight: Circle size affects its weight, influencing its interaction with gravity and other circles.
- Initial Speed: Users can set the initial speed of the circles for dynamic simulations.
